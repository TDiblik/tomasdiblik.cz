TODO:

- Add content to about-me page
- Add content to projects page
- Add content to blog page
- Create special blog post layout
- Add a "reader mode" to blog post layout? - The idea is that current background is not best for reading, add some kind of button that strips most of the css away and makes it really comfortable to read the text.
- Take different pictures of myself, as those used are 2-3 years old.
- Go through all images and make them smaller in size
- Add robots.txt (with sitemap link)
- Add sitemap generation
- Generate SEO metadata
- Minify output files (since source code is available on github)
- Customize 404 page with some kind of game/animation or anything interesting
- Check grammar for every single text on every single page using some kind of automated tool
