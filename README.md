TODO:

- Add content to blog page
- Add a "reader mode" to blog post layout? - The idea is that current background is not best for reading, add some kind of button that strips most of the css away and makes it really comfortable to read the text.
- Take different pictures of myself, as those used are 2-3 years old.
- Go through all images and make them smaller in size
- Generate SEO metadata
- Minify output files (since source code is available on github)
- Customize 404 page with some kind of game/animation or anything interesting
  - Idea: Some kind of fun fact list about this website, for example: Publish date, Number of lines of code,...
- Check grammar for every single text on every single page using some kind of automated tool
