 One day, my friend noticed that when you get a strava.cz account, intentionally or not, 
 username and password are the same - at least at the place we got our accounts from. 
 Also, account's username is a number that goes up gradually - again, at least at the 
 place we got our accounts from. We wondered how many people did not change their default
 passwords (being same as given username). This tool is a proof of concept .... or .... This is what happens when I get bored on saturdays .... ba dum tss (I am 100% aware that was a really lame joke)

 Another long-term project and once again for internal usage, but this one's special!
 Ok, now, close your eyes, and let your imagination off the hook. You have a company that functions since 1953. 
 They have a legacy app (created in the 90s) that needs total rewrite from the ground up. 
 This legacy app contains data since 1970s stored in dBase (before dBase it was excel, and before that paper, but somebody has already done that migration in 1998).
 You have around a year to migrate the data to MSSQL, create the new app and add new features. Welcome to my situation!
 I really enjoyed this rewrite, as it was unique and highly rewarding (even tho I'm usually against rewrites).

 After placing at second place in Funovation Hackathon 22 a couple of weeks prior, 
 we (team.devs) decided to compete on another level .... University hackathon (although there were primarily high school teams) and we won! 
 This time the dream-team with the name team.devs (still very original :D) came in hot with a slightly different cast (Vojtěch didn't have time),
 this time it consisted of Me, Michal Vaniš, Daniel Beneš, and Jan Skládal. This is the story of how we got there :D

 I really like incorporating existing AI's into my projects. To be honest,
 I tried developing AI's multiple time, and it's just (currently) not for me. This project is an example
 of me playing around with multiple AI's, mashing them together and creating something that helps gatekeepers at VPSR.
 This program repeatedly checks Main Gate camera, tries to find a car, and if it finds a car in a selected zone,
 it detects its licence plate and sends it right to the gatekeepers' app (picture + text). I have used two AIs as a base to achieve this,
 yolov7 and alpr-unconstrained.
 It was a really interesting project, and needless to say, it was a fun 2022 summer break!

 This web app is designed to help technicians test out different variables while preparing tanks
 without the need to manually calculate multiple hard calculations, ensuring that they know everything important about each tank.
 Because this software simplifies a lot of calculations, and shows it clearlly in it's UI,
 it significantlly reduces the chance of human error, saves technicians time, and ensures accurate tank preparation.

 This program consists of 5 parts. A desktop application, that allows you to order lunches locally.
 Another desktop application that makes it easy to receive your food by using RFID chip associated with your name.
 A mobile app that allows you to order lunches from the comfort of your home. A web management system that allows HR people to manage lunches,
 export payroll deductions (subsidies included) and block some people from ordering lunches.
 Lastly, an automated task that runs twice per day and sends emails with orders for next day/week to company that's supplying the food.

 I developed a program to control a factory with two parts: a desktop app to set up, manage and control IOT devices,
 and a website to generate graphs and analysis. The app turns devices on/off based on settings,
 such as heating the factory before workers arrive, locking doors in the evening and adjusting temperature in different rooms.
 The desktop app manages and website analyzes data from 21 temperature sensors, 5 humidity sensors and 33 I/O modules
 placed across the factory at VPSR.
 I published first version in early 2021, the program runs there to this day.

 Uarm Swift Pro robotic arm, which I programmed using Python.

 There are a lot of advantages of having a Linux system ready to use, whenever you need to.
 Personally, I rely heavily on WSL in my day-to-day life. Whenever I need to run something Linux-specific,
 it's as easy as opening a new terminal session. I also use docker for virtualizing some services, such as databases, which
 can use WSL to function faster.
