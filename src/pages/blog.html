    VPSR faced an issue where their employees had to 
    monitor the completion of lasered plates and manually replace them. 
    This task took up nearly half of one employee's shift, causing inefficiency 
    in their operations. To address this problem, they decided to purchase a

  it's as easy as opening a new terminal session. I also use docker for virtualizing some services, such as databases, which 
  can use WSL to function faster.
