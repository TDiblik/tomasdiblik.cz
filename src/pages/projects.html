      One day, my friend noticed that when you get a strava.cz account, intentionally or not, 
      username and password are the same - at least at the place we got our accounts from. 
      Also, account's username is a number that goes up gradually - again, at least at the place we got our accounts from. 
      We wondered how many people did not change their default passwords (beeing same as given username). 
      This tool is a proof of concept .... or .... This is what happens when I get bored on saturdays .... ba dum tss (I am 100% aware that was a really lame joke)

      My second hackathon, and we actually won it!
      If it were to become real, the idea was, that people will document and upvote broken spots on the road. 
      We would then match this with region's own datasets of road status, road usage frequency and road repair frequency
      resulting in algoritmically selected recommendation of roads to fix.

      We came in 2nd place, which is fine, but it's not first :D
      At first, the app sounded like a good idea, however after the hackathon ended, 
      we thought about it a little bit more and we decided to abandon the project.
      Mainly because some of the judges, who we thought could help us with a large scale implementation,
      didn't think it had a lot of potential.

      As unbelieveable as it may sound, I've been programming webpages

      so bootstrap was always more than enought. In January 2022 I decided that enought was enought and I needed to learn css.
      At school I had a week long assignment, and I challenged myself to do it in 2 days. This is what came out. 
      The site is not that pretty and has some known bugs, but I've learned a lot while developing it. Since then, my css abilities have grown exponentially!

      Believe it or not, but this was my first real programming project - January 2020. 
      I've written it in Python, because the robotic arm used provided a nice simple Python api.
      This project has been the initial spark for my programming passion! I have spent 2 months 
      perfecting this project (back then, I've never spent that much time on anything except games) 
      and even tho it's a simple python program I'm really proud of it to this day.
