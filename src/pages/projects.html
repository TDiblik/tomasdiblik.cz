      I learned basically everything I know about React and much more while developing this project. What I really enjoyed were
      our weekly syncs, where we would discuss future development, available solutions for problems we were working on
      and much more from the world of programming. Overall, I really enjoyed the collaboration, and am thankful that I was given an opportunity like this.

      Another long-term project and once again for internal usage, but this one's special!
      Ok, now, close your eyes, and let your imagination off the hook. You have a company that functions since 1953. 
      They have a legacy app (created in the 90s) that needs total rewrite from the ground up. 
      This legacy app contains data since 1970s stored in dBase (before dBase it was excel, and before that paper, but somebody has already done that migration in 1998).
      You have around a year to migrate the data to MSSQL, create the new app and add new features. Welcome to my situation!
      I really enjoyed this rewrite, as it was unique and highly rewarding (even tho I'm usually against rewrites).

      It might not look like it, but this website took me some time to develop!
      Code-wise it took me about 2 weeks to make the UI, and code in all the functionality.
      However, you also have to consider all of the work around as development time, such as:
      Figma designs, writing content (took probably 75% of the time in total), minifying images, editing photos, creating a logo, etc...
      I didn't want to use any kind of new fancy/shiny JS framework just to show off, as it would be a total overkill.
      SSG HTML & CSS & a little bit of JS, is more than enought for this.

      This program repeatedly checks Main Gate camera, tries to find a car, and if it finds a car in a selected zone, 
      it detects its licence plate and sends it right to the gatekeepers (picture + text). I am using two AIs to achieve this,

      Program for checking active PCs on network periodically using DNS names or IP addresses.

      Then, this program is the solution for you! You just set it up on some server, add IP(s) or domain names of PCs, 
      SMTP server and you're done. Every night, PCs will get periodically pinged and you'll receive report about their status 
      throughout the night to your mailbox in the morning.
      This program has been developted privatelly for private usage in VPSR, however it has been decided to release the source code (which I'm really thankful for).
