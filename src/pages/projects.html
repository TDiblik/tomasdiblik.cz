      I learned basically everything I know about React and much more while developing this project. What I really enjoyed were
      our weekly syncs, where we would discuss future development, available solutions for problems we were working on
      and much more from the world of programming. Overall, I really enjoyed the collaboration, and am thankful that I was given an opportunity like this.

      Another long-term project and once again for internal usage, but this one's special!
      Ok, now, close your eyes, and let your imagination off the hook. You have a company that functions since 1953. 
      They have a legacy app (created in the 90s) that needs total rewrite from the ground up. 
      This legacy app contains data since 1970s stored in dBase (before dBase it was excel, and before that paper, but somebody has already done that migration in 1998).
      You have around a year to migrate the data to MSSQL, create the new app and add new features. Welcome to my situation!

      KeyXpert is an app for remapping keyboard keys and shortcuts on Windows. 
      It's just a side project I was working on to learn more about win32 API and try out Tauri before using it 
      on a larger project. I've decided, to split the project into two executables, for performance reasons.
      The first one is a mapper service, which starts after boot and only handles the mapping itself. Second one
      is the UI written in Tauri that manages the settings which the mapper service consumes.
      Btw, yes, you can do this with Microsoft PowerToys, however, PowerToys is a whole suite of tools. 
      KeyXpert is optimized to do only one task and that's remapping keys and keyboard shortcuts (less CPU and RAM usage than PowerToys).

      Figma designs, writing content (took probably 75% of the time in total), minifying images, editing photos, creating a logo, etc...

      As unbelievable as it may sound, I've been programming webpages 
      without ever touching CSS from April 2020 until December 2021! I have been making internal programs,
      so bootstrap was always more than enough. In January 2022 I decided that enough was enough and I needed to learn CSS.
      At school, I had a week-long project assignment, and I challenged myself to do it in 2 days. This is what came out. 
      The site is not that pretty and has some known bugs, but I've learned a lot while developing it. Since then, my css abilities have grown exponentially!
