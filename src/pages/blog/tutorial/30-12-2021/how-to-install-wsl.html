<p class="strong-text">
  There are a lot of advantages of having linux system ready to use, whenever you need to.
  Personally, I rely heavily on WSL in my day-to-day life. Whenever I need to run something linux-specific,
  it's as easy as opening a new terminal session. I also use docker for virtualizing some services, such as databases, which 
  can use WSL to function faster.
</p>


<h2>Prerequisites:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Windows 11 OR Windows 10 build 10.0.1903 or later</li>
</ul>


<h2>Enabling Windows virtualization and WSL features</h2>
<p>
  As of today, WSL 1 and 2 require Windows virtualization features. It's also a good idea to have these features 
  enabled by default (VMs or docker can use them). We can do that by going into Powershell (admin mode) and running the following commands:
</p>
<pre class="code-wrapper"><code class="language-powershell">PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart

Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool
Version: 10.0.22621.1

Image Version: 10.0.22621.1105

Enabling feature(s)
[==========================100.0%==========================]
The operation completed successfully.
</code></pre>

<pre class="code-wrapper"><code class="language-powershell">PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart

Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool
Version: 10.0.22621.1

Image Version: 10.0.22621.1105

Enabling feature(s)
[==========================100.0%==========================]
The operation completed successfully.
</code></pre>

<p>
  Now, <span class="strong-text">restart your PC</span> and come back here. I'll be waiting here for you :D.
</p>

<h2>Installing WSL</h2>
<p>
  Already, back? Good! You've now enabled required functionality for WSL. 
  Now, go into console and run (after the command finishes, Windows will probably require another restart): 
</p>
<pre class="code-wrapper"><code class="language-bash">wsl --install</code></pre>
<p>
  If installation begins, continue by reading next paragraph. If not, and command is not found, or not available, 
  it's probable that you need to download and install WSL2 Linux kernel update package for x64 machines from official 
  <a 
    href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package" 
    class="underline" 
    {% include external_link.html %}>
      Microsoft's official documentation</a>
  or by clicking 
  <a 
    href="https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi" 
    class="underline" 
    {% include external_link.html %}>
      here</a>
  (I wouldn't trust random blog post either, but the download link is hard to see in the docs, and link ref is official microsoft domain :D).
  After you're done installing it, you should try running the previous command. At this point, everything should work fine.
</p>

<p>
  The only thing we need to do now, is run the following command and we're done.
</p>
<pre class="code-wrapper"><code class="language-bash">wsl --set-default-version 2</code></pre>

<p>
  Right now, you either already have latest Ubuntu wsl installed (behaviour on newer versions of wsl),
  or have to install it from Microsoft Store, just search Ubuntu and click on download. 
  It was pretty easy wasn't it?
