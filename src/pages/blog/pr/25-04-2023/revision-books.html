post_introduction: 
  Another long-term project and once again for internal usage, but this one's special!
  Ok, now, close your eyes, and let your imagination off the hook. You have a company that functions since 1953. 
  They have a legacy app (created in the 90s) that needs total rewrite from the ground up. 
  This legacy app contains data since 1970s stored in dBase (before dBase it was excel, and before that paper, but somebody has already done that migration in 1998).
  You have around a year to migrate the data to MSSQL, create the new app and add new features. Welcome to my situation!
  I really enjoyed this rewrite, as it was unique and highly rewarding (even tho I'm usually against rewrites).
