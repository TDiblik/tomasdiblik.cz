post_introduction: 
    After placing at second place in <a href='/pages/blog/pr/20-04-2023/attending-funovation-hackathon-22.html' target='_blank' class='strong-text underline'>Funovation Hackathon 22</a> a couple of weeks prior, 
    we (team.devs) decided to compete on another level .... University hackathon (althougt there were primarly high school teams) and we won! 
    This time the dream-team with the same name team.devs (still very original :D) came in hot with slightly different cast (Vojtěch didn't have time),
    this time it consisted of Me,
    <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/michal-vanis/' class='strong-text underline' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer noopener external'>Michal Vaniš</a>, 
    <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-bene%C5%A1-6abb7b205/' class='strong-text underline' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer noopener external'>Daniel Beneš</a>, and 
    <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-skl%C3%A1dal-6050a2244/' class='strong-text underline' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer noopener external'>Jan Skládal</a> 
    This is the story of how we got there :D

<p> 
    This hackathon has been significantlly more time-contrained than the previous one (Funovation 22), since we had around 5 hours to brainstorm the idea 
    and code the prototype. But as always, we spent like 1 hour (meaning 1/5 of the whole time) thinking about the idea (reasons stated in the <a href='/pages/blog/pr/20-04-2023/attending-funovation-hackathon-22.html' target='_blank' class='underline'>previous blog post</a>).
</p>
<p> 
    We eventually agreed on making an application/social media site where users would be able to rate quality of roads and upvote/downvote 
    pictures submited by other users. This system of voting would then affect how and where the town office spends it's budget on repairing those roads.
    If you want to find out more about the application itself, the <a href="https://github.com/TDiblik/RouteMapper" target="_blank" class="underline" {% include external_link.html %}>project's Github repository</a> is probably your best resource.
    You can find showcase and development instructions in README, however you can also see initial designs inside the RoadMapper.fig file and presentation inside the RoadMapper.pptx.
    You may notice the confusing naming (RouteMapper vs RoadMapper), well, basically, I made a typo while creating the Github repository and we noticed like 5 minutes before submitting :D.
    It's supposed to be called RoadMapper, however for legacy reasons, we left it called RouteMapper.
</p>
<p> 
    When it comes to our iteration process, we've basically followed the startegy we used at the <a href='/pages/blog/pr/20-04-2023/attending-funovation-hackathon-22.html' target='_blank' class='underline'>Funovation hackathon 22</a>, because it worked that well.
    I really recommend reading the previous article for all the details. As for our tech-stack, we've learned not to use <a href="https://expo.dev/" class="underline" {% include external_link.html %}> Expo</a>,
    when we're going to present a website anyways, so we made it in <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/" target="_blank" class="underline" {% include external_link.html %}>CRA</a> to allow faster iteration process
    and made it very clear during the presentation that this would be a mobile native app (with possibility to throw it on the web as well with wasm). For API, we once again chose  <a href="https://expressjs.com/" class="underline" {% include external_link.html %}>Express</a>,
    because of the ease of use for prototyping.
</p>
<p> 
    Time flew by and eventually we had to submit and present our project. The presentation went smoothly imo and to be honest, we were completely caught off guard when the judges announced us as the winners.
    I really liked the hackathon because it was not set around any theme, but more around taking already open datasets, mashing them together and creating something that could have potential.
    I gotta say, that I was really suprised how much open data the Královehradecký Kraj <a href="https://www.datakhk.cz/" class="underline" {% include external_link.html %}>publishes/exports online</a> for free use.
    Also, unbeknownst to me, the Czech Republic itself publishes <a href="https://data.gov.cz/" class="underline" {% include external_link.html %}>A LOT</a> of open data, which I'm gonna totally use for some of my future projects.
