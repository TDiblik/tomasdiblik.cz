    we (team.devs) decided to compete on another level .... University hackathon (althougt there were primarly high school teams) and we won! 
    This time the dream-team with the same name team.devs (still very original :D) came in hot with slightly different cast (Vojtěch didn't have time),

<p> 
    This hackathon has been significantlly more time-contrained, since we had around 5 hours to brainstorm the idea 
    and code the prototype. But as allways, we spent like 1 hour (meaning 1/5 of the whole time) thinking about the idea.
