post_introduction: 
  Microsoft Student Trainee Center is a selective program for high school students with a passion for modern technologies and a desire to pass on 
  their knowledge. They/We are a community that shares their passion to innovate. I somehow got into this program, here's how it went :D

{% include heading.html level="2" text="Introduction" %}
<p>
  In January 2021 I got accepted into <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cs-cz/education/students/stc" class="underline" {% include external_link.html %}>Microsoft Student Trainee Center</a>,
  and I was really hyped about it. As a programmer, I was logically put into the Azure Programming Action Group, which I knew I wanted right after reading about STC for the first time. I knew beforehand that this program is more IT/Marketing focused as 
  opposed to being purely technical, however I was ok with that, since my PR/Marketing/Soft skills were mid at best at the time (still kinda strugling :D). But what is STC?
  Well, for more PR(e) read, you can use the link above, however if you want to experience it from my point of view, keep on reading!
</p>
<p>
  Fist of all, they set you up with their accounts, since it's fully remote. Then they explain you their values and believes, which is totaly reasonable since they are a comunity and 
  every comunity has some rules. Then in the span of half a year, you get an in-depth introduction into the office suite with certification vouchers at the end, to prove your skills.
  The second half of the year and the second year in general is more cloud oriented, you will gain a lot of in-depth knowledge about the Microsoft's cloud ecosystem, especially Azure and Microsoft 365 Admininstration.
</p>
<p>
  During all of this, there are a lot of other webinars about specific topics, team buildings, hackathons, Microsoft events, STC events, and a lot of other optional extra activities you can participate in. 
  If you want to spend time learning and growing, you will be given the opportunity, but it has to be from your own initiative (which is a good thing in my opinion). 
  You're not forced to do anything extra, but usually students decide to put their time and effort into these extra activities.
  In general, the more time you put into the program and help out others, the more opportunities and gained knowledge will come back your way.
</p>
<p>
  Then "graduation" comes around. You can either choose your own topic for your "graduation project", or you can pick one from the options that are provided every year.
  Personally, I believe that it's better to pick one of the provided options, instead of choosing your own one, because a lot of the times, you'll be cooperating on the project with STC partnered company
  (like <a href="https://www.kpcs.cz/" class="underline" {% include external_link.html %}>KPCS CZ</a> in my case).
  After some consideration, I picked migration from on-premises to Azure as my final project. I don't actually know how much of the finished work can be published, so here's only the abstract and table of contenst (to give you general feel about the contents):
</p>
<pre class="code-wrapper medium"><code class="language-zsh">  --------- ABSTRACT ---------
  The topic of this thesis will be the migration of one Ubuntu 22.04 server from on-premises to the cloud. 
  Maximum downtime is one hour, between 18:00 and 19:00 on earlier specified day. 
  The server is running automated tasks, docker containers, nginx and a bunch of other services. 
  The task assignment is to move the linux server to the cloud, configure ssh server, 
  check that all programs are set up and running correctly. 
  The work will include analysis of cloud options, analysis of the on-premis server, 
  analysis of the options provided by the selected cloud provider for migration, 
  several migration plans, selection of the best strategy, execution of the work, 
  final summary of the whole work.

{% include heading.html level="2" text="The good" %}
<ol>
  <li>
    I was given the oporutnity to develop part of the internal infrastructure for like half a year. During this time, I got really 
    familiar with Microsoft's Graph API and generally coding with close integration of Microsoft products. 
    Personally, this alone could be the sole reason to go into STC once again.
  </li>
  <li>
    STC provided me with certifications vouches, which allow(ed) me to prove that I actually know the things I claim to know.
  </li>
  <li>
    STC started and fueled my passion for writing blog posts and sharing code/information in general.
  </li>
  <li>
    The in-person meetings - just believe me on this one, because it could be another post in itself :D
  </li>
</ol>

{% include heading.html level="2" text="The bad" %}
<p>
  Everything has some negative aspects to it, unfortunatelly, STC has/had some as well. One of the biggest problems I saw, was the management.
  The program was still in it's (what I would consider) "early" days, when I got in. This meant that during the two years I was there, 
  I saw the leadership "restructure" at least twice!
  I believe that nowdays it's not that big of a problem and the current management is more or less stable, however I found that kinda annoying at the time.
</p>

{% include heading.html level="2" text="Is it worth it?" %}
<p>
  Yeah, <span class="strong-text">probably</span>. If you're more technical (like me), there are people who are more than happy to help you 
  with anything related to security/programming/IT with an in-depth explanations, but as for the rest of the "org", they're more PR/Marketing focused.
  If you don't know where to start, or want to perfect your understanding of Microsoft technologies, you should consider joining,
  however, if you already have a really solid understanding of Microsoft technologies, and keep yourself periodically informed about lates Microsoft stuff, the program itself will not provide you 
  with any new knowledge. That being said, the two crucial benefits that the program will provide you with, regardless of your knwoledge/skill level, are:
  connections to talented people (from range of domains) who know their stuff AND oportunities (like certifications, internal development, helping out at Microsoft events, and many more).
  Is that worth it? Depends on your own personal/professional goals/preferences, but I would highly suggest you at least try it. You can end at any time.
