post_introduction: 
  One day, my friend noticed that when you get a strava.cz account, intentionally or not, 
  username and password are the same - at least at the place we got our accounts from. 
  Also, account's username is a number that goes up gradually - again, at least at the 
  place we got our accounts from. We wondered how many people did not change their default
  passwords (being same as given username). This tool is a proof of concept .... or .... 
  This is what happens when I get bored on saturdays .... 
  ba dum tss (I am 100% aware that was a really lame joke)

{% include heading.html level="2" text="What's the problem?" %}
<p>
  New/Existing strava.cz accounts from a specific canteen (I don't have data on other canteens) have 
  default and predictable username + password. Change is not enforced upon users, so some users
  may leave it like that. We can then send login request using these predictable credentials and optain
  access to these accounts.
</p>

{% include heading.html level="2" text="How big of a problem is this?" %}
<p>
  It's hard to tell without having internal data/statistics, but I believe that 
  this specific "vulnerability" (arguable if it even is a vulnerability) is not affecting a large chunk of 
  users. I don't even know whether to call this a vulnerability, because it's no different than running
  script that goes through a rainbow table.
  However, I believe that the chunk of users that it affects could have a bad time :D. After some digging,
  I found some interesting functionalities, that the potential attacker could use to cause some damage to the company's reputation,
  presuming that the attacker has obtained a list of all vulnerable accounts using this "vulnerability", after running the code provided for like a month.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Fun fact, if you want to reset e-mail or password, you can do that with 1 request (after obtaining authentication).
    NO need to login once again, or confirm the reset through email, it just resets it.
    This means that the potential attacker could take the list of people with default login 
    and then massively reset everybody's email and password (causing irl Denial of Service).
  </li>
  <li>
    If this potentional attacker has a list of all vulnerable accounts, they could theoretically
    cancel everybody's lunches at the same time, causing suply chain problems (if the number of vulnerable accounts is big enough).
  </li>
  <li>
    As an attacker you could also use this "vulnerability" on a smaller scale, attacking individuals by changing
    their lunches or seeing part of their schedule without "stalking them" in real world (on the spot).
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Severity of all of these potential attacks depends on the number of vulnerable accounts, which I don't have,
  legally cannot findout and won't take a guess.
</p>

{% include heading.html level="2" text="How hard is this to \"exploit\"?" %}
<p>
  First of all, I have only basic level understanding when it comes to black box penetration testing (atm).
  This whole program could have been a simple bash for loop. 
  Somebody could theoretically make this run as multiple tasks on multiple cores and scale really well - at real time of <code class="language-unknown inline">([r * k] / [t * c]) - r => number_of_requests ; k => request response time ; t => tasks spawned ; c => cores used</code>,
  however since this project is for educational purposes only, I am NOT going to implement that.
  Nevertheless that approach should be currentlly possible to implement, because AFAIK strava does not rate limit requests.
</p>

{% include heading.html level="2" text="Possible fixes" %}
<ol>
  <li>The obvious one is to not allow same username and password (After first login show users page to change their password or something...)</li> 
  <li>Implement two factor authentication</li>
  <li>Instruct administrators of canteens to use randomly generated usernames and passwords</li>
  <li>Place already existing bot/spam prevention solution in front of the website (eg. Cloudflare's WAF)</li>
  <li>Rate limit login attempts using fingerprinting - although this could be penetrated by randomly changing values used for said fingerprinting.</li>
</ol>
