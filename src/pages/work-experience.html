    I'm basically a universal programmer there. I'm programming everything from
    microcontrollers, desktop apps, web apps. I'm managing database servers,
    Linux servers, on-premises and cloud-hosted stuff. I'm the guy that makes
    almost every piece of custom software that runs there. Over the period of
    almost 3 years, I've made 15+ different apps and learned A LOT, since I'm
    spending most of my time just creating new software for them or
    improving/maintaining existing one. I mostly use C# and TypeScript, but I
    also sometimes turn to Rust/Python when needed. Pick the right tool for the
    job.

    During my one-month internship at PwC in Bratislava, I participated in the
    development of the entire project from planning to implementation in a
    three-member team of software engineers. The internship consisted of 50%
    infrastructure, wireframing, mockups, figuring out the project logic. The
    other 50% was hands-on implementation. My work was all frontend, but I was
    also involved in a large part of the backend (e.g. implementing user
    authentication and authorization, partially inventing the database
    structure,...). During the project I worked with React, Django, Docker and
    Azure Cloud
